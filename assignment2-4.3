Managing data better:

In today's world the data is growing at a rapid pace and needs to be managed dynamically with access to it everywhere.
Thus big data technologies like hadoop and spark provide solutions to managing such huge amounts of data with the facility to analyze data and collect and sift through various types of data.It also allows users to process the raw data without knowing much of technical do-how.

Speed,Capacity and Scalability of cloud:

Such large datasets need to be analysed and stored quickly.The major problems that today data faces is of storage and processing.Therefore the speed with which data gets processed and stored neds large capacity that big data technologies provide in a virtual environment.Also it provides scalability. 

End users can visualize data:

Big data technologies provide data visulaization tools such as easy-to-read charts, graphs and slideshows.Due to the vast quantities of data being examined, these applications offer processing engines that let end users query and manipulate information quickly.
